{"name":"S.brute","tagline":"","body":"Subdomain-bruteforcer\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThis is a (fast) multi-threaded python tool for enumerating subdomains.  This tool also contains a large list of real subdomains that you will find in the wild.  Basically I was fed up with fierce / fierce2, and every other tool I used so I wrote something way faster in python.   This tool will \"just work\",  and work well.   By default this tool performs subdomain enumeration about 8 times faster than Fierce, and can chew through 31k lookups in about 5 minutes on a home cable connection.\r\n\r\n## Why is this tool so fast?\r\n\r\nOther multi-threaded subdomain enumeration tools that I have seen are bottlenecked by using a single resolver.   In SubBrute, each thread is given its own slice of the resolvers list (resolvers.txt) so that a single resolver isn't overwhelmed.  The subdomain list (subs.txt) is sorted by frequency, so this tool will return the most common domains quickly.  \r\n\r\nUsing some creative google hacks I put together a disorganized list of well over a million domain names,  I then used a regex to rip out the subdomains and then sorted them by frequency. You can also use this data-mangling feature by using using this simple command:\r\n<br>_python subroute.py -f full.html > my_subs.txt_\r\n\r\nI used this feature to create subs.txt which contains 31291 subdomains.\r\n\r\n## Easy to install:\r\nYou just need http://www.dnspython.org/ and python2.7 or python3.  \r\nThis tool should work under any operating system:  bsd, osx, windows, linux...\r\n\r\n_sudo apt-get install python-dnspython_\r\n\r\n## Easy to use:\r\n\r\n_./subbrute.py google.com_\r\n\r\n## Tests multiple domains:\r\n_./subbrute.py google.com gmail.com blogger.com_\r\n\r\n## Or a newline delimited list of domains:\r\n_./subbrute.py -t list.txt_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
